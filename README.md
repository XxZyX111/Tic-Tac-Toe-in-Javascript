# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-Javascript
Basically a tic tac toe game system inside a computer language by using javascript, it tells the player which direction to move and to attack the other opponments. Just like in real life whether the first or the second player chose the Exes(X) or the Circles(O) and thats pretty much it.
